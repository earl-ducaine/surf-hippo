To compile:

cd ../tools
make

cd ../ntscable
make

The directory "Input" contains samples of morphology files
in all of the formats recognized by ntscable.  The directory
"Output" contains translations of these.  The shell script
"test" tests the most recently compiled version of ntscable by
duplicating in the directory "Test" the translations contained 
in "Output"; it compares the standard translations in Output
with those in Test via the cmp command.
