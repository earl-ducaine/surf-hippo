This directory contains the hoc files for performing the
Rallpack simulations using NEURON version 2.43

Each directory has a series of .hoc files used for performing the simulations
at assorted model sizes and timesteps. There are also UNIX shell scripts
which make the benchmarks a little easier to run. 

In order to run the simulations with the Crank-Nicolson method one should
insert the line
secondorder=1
after the runtime assignment.

These simulations were run by U.S. Bhalla and David H. Bilitch at Caltech,
July 1992. To the best of our knowledge they are a reasonable implementation
of the simulations in NEURON. We would welcome corrections and updated
benchmark results from more experienced users. Please address comments to  :
