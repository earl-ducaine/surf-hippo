This directory contains information on installing Surf-Hippo. For most
users, the information in surf-hippo/quick-start.txt should be sufficient,
otherwise, consult installation.doc.txt in this directory. 

Surf-Hippo requires that certain Unix environment variables be
set. This may be done in the appropriate shell initialization file,
and examples are given in the .bashrc and .cshrc files.

If Surf-Hippo is to be run out of Emacs using SLIME, there are
initializations that should be included in your .emacs initialization
file - see the .emacs file in this directory.
