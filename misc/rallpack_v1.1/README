			RALLPACKS version 1.1

The Rallpacks are a set of benchmarks for evaluating neuronal simuators.
The original idea was proposed at the Analysis and Modeling of Neural
Systems meeting in San Francisco in July 1991.

This is an updated version, incorporating suggestions from many people.
We would like to express our appreciation to everyone who helped with the
original ideas and development of the Rallpacks. A partial list includes 
Frank Eeckman, Erik De Schutter, John Miller, Michael Hines, Mark Nelson,
Tony Zador, and of course, Wilfrid Rall, who pioneered much of
the field and kindly consented to have his name associated with these 
benchmarks.

The models and C programs are identical to the previous version, except for
slight improvements to comparisons/srms.c to improve its ability to handle
unexpected spike shapes.
The definitions of the performance measures have changed substantially, but
should be easy to derive from older values. An effort has been made to 
choose performance measures which are independent of model size.
The specification of the format of the report is hopefully more precise.

The models allow more flexibility in model size and timestep in order to
accomodate simulators running on less powerful machines, or using different
kinds of integration methods.

Feedback in terms of suggestions for further improvements, and as results
for simulators tested using the Rallpacks, would be greatly appreciated.

Memory use.

Definitions :
	Simulation run time= Time in seconds to run model.

		= raw speed * timestep.
        Accuracy= The average for the first and last compartments, of normalized
                rms difference between 'correct' and simulated curves, as
                measured by the 'rms' program for Rallpacks 1 and 2, and the
		'srms' program for Rallpack 3
	Asysmptotic accuracy= Limiting (best) accuracy achieved as timesteps
		are decreased.
	Semi-accurate timestep= Timestep at which error is <= twice the
		asymptotic accuracy.
	Setup time= time to load the simulator and model into memory.
        Base memory= Memory used to load the simulator.
        Model memory= Additional memory used when the model has been loaded
                and run.
        Model size= Number of compartments in model.
        Model memory per compartment = Model memory/Model size
	Compartment equivalents= Ratio of CPU time spent on specified model
		component to time spent on single nonbranching compartment.

The Rallpack report.
	The Rallpack report is intended to capture the essential performance 
	features of the simulator and provide a basis for comparison between
	simulators. It consists of the general report, which condenses all the
	results into a few numbers, and the detailed reports for each
	individual Rallpack.

	Detailed report :
	1 Accuracy vs. Timestep
	2 Accuracy vs. Simulation speed
                A set of simulations of the same model size should be run at
		a range of timesteps, and the accuracy and simulation speed
		should be calculated for each case.
                The timesteps should cover the 'useful' range for the model,
                within which the accuracy goes from close to its asymptotic
                (best) value to a few % error. Typical timesteps are
                10,20,50,100,200,500 and 1000 usec. The recommended model size
		is 1000 compartments (1023 for the branching case). The
		model size should be quoted.
		These results can be tabulated and/or graphed.
                If the raw speed is independent of timestep (i.e. the
		simulation speed is directly proportional to timestep, which is
		usually true) the two graphs can be merged, and the respective
		x axis scales should be displayed.
                The x axis may be displayed on a log scale.

	3 Raw speed vs. Model size
	4 Model memory per compartment vs. Model size
                A set of simulations with a range of model sizes should
                be carried out, calculating the raw speed and model memory
		for each case. All simulations should use the same timestep,
		which should be quoted. The suggested timestep is 50 usec.
                Recommended model sizes are 1, 10, 100, 1000 and 10000
                compartments, or nearby values for the branched cable model.
		These results can be tabulated and/or graphed.
		If graphed, they may be displayed on the same graph with
                the two y axis scales displayed.
                The x axis may be displayed on a log scale.

Notes on generating the report.

1	The recommended values for model size and timestep should be adopted
unless simulator or machine constraints prevent it.

1.1	Simulator constraints.
If a simulator utilizes explicit integration schemes, the timesteps
necessary for accuracy may be prohibitively small. The cable equations are
numerically quite stiff, which means that explicit solutions need timesteps
of the order of the square of the length constants of compartments.
To get around this, an alternative model size of 50 compartments should be
used for rallpacks 1 and 3, so each compartment is now 20 microns long.
These give a length constant of 0.02 per compartment, which is about the upper
limit for reasonable accuracy for spike propagation for the HH parameters.
(Cooley and Dodge, Biophys J. 6; pp 583-599; 1966)
When using compartments of this size, the Exponential Euler method in GENESIS 
gives an accuracy of around 1.5% for Rallpack 3 at a timestep of 5 usec.
The branched model in rallpack 2 involves compartments with a length
constant of 0.008, which should be OK for explicit
methods with timesteps in the microsecond range.

1.2	Machine memory constraints.
If the 1000 compartment models occupy too much memory, then the reduction
to 50 compartments described in the previous section should be carried
out for rallpacks 1 and 3. Rallpack 2 should be reduced to 64 compartments
(6 levels of branching), and the reference curves for Rallpack 2 will have to 
be recalculated to take into account the reduced electrotonic length.

1.3	Machine speed constraints.
If the total run time of the simulations is unreasonably long,
it is OK to reduce the simulation time to 0.05 sec. This is long enough
to generate sufficient data points for a meaningful comparison of error.
Further reductions are not recommended, as this simulation time only includes
a portion of the charging curves for rallpacks 1 and 2 and just 4 spikes
for rallpack 3. The combined reductions of model size by a factor of 20
(see 1.1,1.2) and simulation time by a factor of 5 should be sufficient for
most simulators to be tested in a reasonable amount of time.
				*-----*

2	Simulators employing variable timesteps can use them as long as the
output is sampled at the specified intervals.
				*-----*

3	The srms program may have difficulties at large timesteps if the
simulator is tending to be unstable. If errors are suspected, the -out
option will show the interpolated curves that the routine is basing its
calculations on.
				*-----*

4	The rms and srms programs generate normalized error values. These
should be scaled by 100 to get % error. The AVERAGE of the values for the 
two curves is the value being reported.
				*-----*

5	The compartmental equivalents are calculated by comparing the 
simulation run times with those for the cable model (Rallpack 1).
Rallpack 2 has approximately the same number of branching compartments,
so there the equivalent is simply the ratio of the simulation run times.
In Rallpack 3 there are 2000 HH channels and 1000 compartments, as compared
to the 1000 compartments of Rallpack 1. Therefore the compartment equivalent
for HH channels is : 
	(runtime3-runtime1)/(runtime1*2)

Using the report :
	The Rallpacks are primarily intended to enable objective evaluation
of the performance of simulators in terms of speed and accuracy.
We do not recommend the Rallpacks as the primary factor in selecting
a simulator since there are many other aspects of simulator use that
are not addressed here. The Rallpacks also provide a tool
for making informed trade-offs between speed and accuracy for a particular
simulation.
Three parameters are evaluated for the general report which provide a concise
(and potentially misleading) overall performance measure.

1 Peak speed is the best raw speed value obtained over the range of model sizes.
	This is a rough measure of the sheer crunching ability of the 
	simulator. This measure is designed to be independent of model size
	and timestep. In conjunction with the compartmental equivalents it
	indicates simulator speed across a wide range of models.
2 Asymptotic accuracy indicates the best accuracy attainable for the model 
	using the simulator. It may be unrealistic, such as for simulators
	using explicit methods where eventually one can get an asymptotically
	good result but needs an extremely small timestep to do so.
3 Semi-accurate timestep is the longest timestep for which the error is less
	than 2x the asymptotic error. This is usually a good, conservative
	timestep at which to run the simulator.

A careful evaluation of a simulator should involve the complete results
from the detailed Rallpack report. A complete Rallpack report should facilitate
the following tasks :

	1. Evaluating a simulator.
	The Accuracy vs. Simulation Speed curves for the three rallpacks are
	meant to enable direct comparisons between different simulators and
	an evaluation of the regions in which each performs best. A low value
	of error and a high simulation speed is the desired combination.

	2. Evaluating the numerical properties of the simulator algorithm.
	The Accuracy-timestep curve gives a hardware-independent estimate
	of the intrinsic numerical properties of the simulator algorithms and
	implementation. It enables one to determine the timestep required to
	achieve a given accuracy on the simulator.
	
	3. Estimating time and memory requrirements for a particular simulation.
	The present set of Rallpacks can be used to estimate these values
	for models consisting only of compartments, branching compartments
	and channels using the Hodgkin-Huxley formalism. All the components
	of the model are converted to compartment equivalents and summed to
	get an estimate of the total computational requirements.

	Runtime =
		Simulated time *
		(ncompartments * 1
		+ nbranches * compartment equivalents for branched compartments
		+ nchannels * compartment equivalents for HH channels) /
			Simulation speed for rallpack1


	The required memory for the model may in principle be computed
	in a similar way, but is more prone to scaling errors.

	Required memory =
		Base memory
		+ ncompartments * memory per compartment
		+ nbranches * memory per branching compartment
		+ nchannels * memory per channel.
