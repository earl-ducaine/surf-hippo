In Section 9.7.1:

  In the present version, $\Delta x_{ij}$ is taken to be one cm (to
  match the units of the diffusion coefficient), whereas the true
  diffusional distances are on the order of one micron.

should be:

  In the present version, $\Delta x_{ij}$ is taken to be 10 microns,
  whereas the true diffusional distances are on the order of one micron.
