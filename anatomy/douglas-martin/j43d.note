bug in j43d					4/7/95 lbg

cell segment 11-11-2 is a branch point corresponding to line 2169 in
the original j43d file. In the original file, the diameter given is
0.3 um. The proximal segment diameter and the two daughter segment
diameters are 4.0, 2.7 and 3.3 um, respectively. In the lisp file for
j43d then, we have edited the diameter of 11-11-2 to be 3.3 um.

Note that this is edited twice in the lisp file since segments just
distal to branch points appear twice in the list.
