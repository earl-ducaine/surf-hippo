A convenient place for putting Lisp files of model circuits. Default directory for the
*CIRCUIT-DIRECTORY* variable.  This directory contains scripts of LISP code for later reference.
These can be particularly useful when running a series of simulations directly from LISP (i.e. via
the LISP interpreter).

The files in this directory should be loadable directly into LISP, or contain forms which are
loadable.

Check also the examples in the demos subdirectory.
