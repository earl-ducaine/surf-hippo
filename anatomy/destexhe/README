Text  Cell 51/2A - Cat SS cortex, layer 6, pyr.  A. Destexhe, Salk Institute

Alain Destexhe, June 1996: added reduction of the diameter of the dendrites
(diamred), based on Larkmann, U.  J Comp Neurol 306:307, 1991: the diameters
of this cell are significantly larger than the normal, probably due to the
histological procedure (?).  A correction factor of diamred=0.7 (same as the
Layer 5 cell traced in the same slice) restores it to normal, with an area of
about 21564 um2 (soma unchanged).

(diamred), based on Larkmann, U.  J Comp Neurol 306:307, 1991: the diameters
of this cell are significantly larger than the normal, probably due to the
histological procedure (?).  The total area of the cell (about 120000 um2!) is
much larger that the average area of thick layer 5 cells.  A correction factor
of diamred=0.7 restores it to normal, with an area of about 91620 um2 (soma
unchanged)
