;; Code for ordering the circuit and solving the almost tri-diagonal matrix, taken from Hines 1984.


(in-package "SURF-HIPPO")



;;; ** APPLYING THE METHOD OF HINES TO THE BRANCHED TREE STRUCTURE OF EACH CELL **

;;; (Note that for the Hines method, "delta-v" is actually V(t + dt/2).)

;;; This description of branches is derived from Hines, "Efficient computation of branched nerve equations" Int. J. Bio-Medical Computing (15) (1984)
;;; p69-76. A branch is composed of connected segments. The ends of the branch are determined by those segments which (at either end of the segment)
;;; connect to more than one segment. The branches of a cell, and in turn the branch segments, are numbered as follows: Choose any branch of the tree which
;;; is connected at one end to the soma. Number the segments of that branch so that the segment connected to the soma is the last segment. The first
;;; segment of this branch ('trunk') will be called the 'branch node'. Note that this branch node is not the same thing as a true circuit node (as
;;; referenced by Surf-Hippo).

;;; The soma is also considered a 'branch node'.

;;; All branches connecting to a branch node have their segments numbered so that their last segment connects to this node. Their first segments are also
;;; called branch nodes (as long as other segments are connected to them), and this segment-numbering process continues until all the segments are
;;; numbered. The last numbered branches, or 'twigs', all have one end (their first segments) unconnected. Each branch node becomes the center of a Wye
;;; network.

;;; Continue this procedure for all other segments connected to the soma.

;;; Branches are numbered as follows: Assume that there are N branches. Starting at soma, number all the branches connecting to the soma starting with N
;;; and decrementing. Continue numbering all the branches that are connected to the previous set of branches, decrementing the branch number.  Continue
;;; working out on the tree until all the branches are labeled.

;;; The two circuit nodes (proximal and distal) associated with each segment are ordered according to the branch number and the number of the attached
;;; segment in the proximal direction. Note that since the circuit is a tree, there will only be one such segment for each node, whereas there can be
;;; multiple segments attached to a node in the distal direction. For example, if branch 33 has 2 segments and branch 34 has 3 segments, then the nodes
;;; would be ordered: ...33-1, 33-2, 34-1, 34-2, 34-3... The soma node has the highest node index.

(defun build-branch-list (seg)
 ;; This is called from LOCATE-CELL-NODES, where cell nodes are located seqentially from the soma outward, and from GET-AND-LOCATE-DISTAL-SEGMENTS, which
  ;; is called recursively from LOCATE-CELL-NODES (for each branch originating at the soma).

;;; Upper triangularization of the matrix is accomplished by repeated applications of the procedure TRIANG. Define a 'twig' as any branch whose distal end
;;; is *not* connected to an un-TRIANGed branch (including no branch at all). Now upper triangularize the matrix by doing the following until there are
;;; only twigs left: Collect the set of all current twigs, except any twigs which have already been TRIANGed. Apply TRIANG to the remaining set of twigs,
;;; in the order that they appear in the matrix(?). Repeat.
