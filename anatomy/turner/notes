          hello (again)

          all of the L* files are CA3 in vivo cells from the J Comp
          Neurol article with Buzsaki this summer.  the n12? files are
          in vitro CA1.  i have lots more if you are interested but we
          are not quite ready to release the CA1 in vivo (still works
          in progress) cells.

          dennis

          hello

          the *.asc files and *.3dn files are uncorrected and you
          would need to correct them for shrinkage.

          best wishes

          dennis
