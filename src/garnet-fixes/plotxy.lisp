;; Plotting points in a window with axes.

; The GRAPHING-AGGREGATE holds a pair of axes and a subwindow (graphing-window).
; The axes have ticks and labels.
; Here, W means either X or Y (for horizontal axis, it is X, for vertical, Y)
; W-TO-LABEL is a function from a W to a string for a tick
; mark at that position.  The default function just calls FORMAT with
; the value of :TICK-FORMAT, which defaults to a string which displays W 
; as a floating point.

; If you want plain integer labels, change tick-format to "~D".
; If you want nominal labels instead, make w-to-label a function like
;   (lambda (x) (nth (round x) '("A" "B" "C" "D" "E" "F" "G" "H" "I" "J" "K"))))

; it would be nice if the Y axis text ran vertically.  It would be
; nice to have more flexible control over placement of axes.  For
; instance, you might want the axes drawn at 0,0 even if it's off the
; screen.

; The parent of the tick mark is a tick-list.  The parent of the
; tick-list is an axis.  The parent of the axis is the graph
; aggregate.  The graph aggregate specifies the actual position of the
; axes.
