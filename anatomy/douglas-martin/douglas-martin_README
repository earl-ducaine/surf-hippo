We do like to know where its going, and who is doing what to whom!
So please to pass it on to whoever, with the request
1) that the source be acknowledged if used in publication (thats important
for us to find cash for person to make many more of these, including
the forthcoming axons), and that we get a copy of publication.
2) to send me an email, saying they have got it.
3) if it is passed on again, to transmit also these requests.
thanks, r
